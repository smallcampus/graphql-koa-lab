# graphql-koa-lab

This is a research project on how to implement a graphql server with koa

The associated client side project is https://github.com/smallcampus/graphql-vue-lab

To get start:

Install and start a mongodb
`npm start`

Feature:

+ Koa
+ Apollo 
+ Typegraphql

TODO:

+ Try out websocket with apollo
+ Try implement auth with jwt
+ Try graphql data loader

Note:
After you have update the data model, a new schema.graphql will be generated in graphql/schema.graphql.
Currently you have to copy the file manually to the client side project to update the schema on their side.
